The Events App helps organize events (like meetups, shows, talks, etc). Built with Node and ExpressJS, Database Powered by MongoDB.

It features read/write authorization, RestFUL Routing, User Authentication, and CRUD database operations.

It was built as an extension of a Udemy Course I took... The course goes through a similar app called YelpCamp. This is my own take on that, with some changes and minor improvements.

Putting to use the principles and concepts learned in the course. I wanted to build something of my own. The course itself goes through the development of a pretty substantial full-stack web app called YelpCamp, I wanted to give building something like that entirely by myself a shot.
